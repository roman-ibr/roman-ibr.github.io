We present a new multi-robot system as a means of creating a visual communication cue that can add dynamic illustration to static figures or diagrams to enhance the power of delivery and improve an audience's attention. The proposed idea is that when a presenter/speaker writes something such as a shape or letter on a whiteboard table, multiple mobile robots trace the shape or letter while dynamically expressing it. The dynamic movement of multi-robots will further stimulate the cognitive perception of the audience with handwriting, positively affecting the comprehension of content. To do this, we apply image processing algorithms to extract feature points from a handwritten shape or letter while a task allocation algorithm deploys multi-robots on the feature points to highlight the shape or letter. We present preliminary experiment results that verify the proposed system with various characters and letters such as the English alphabet.
