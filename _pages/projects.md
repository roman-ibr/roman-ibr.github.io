<h4> <b> Resilient Extra-Terrestrial Habitats (RETH) </b> </h4>

      Deep space habitats require groundbreaking technological advances to overcome the unprecedented demands introduced by isolation and extreme environments. An Earth-independent permanent extraterrestrial habitat system must function as intended under continuous disruptive conditions that occur during both manned and unmanned conditions. Designing for the demands that extreme environments will place on long-term deep space habitats, such as wild temperature fluctuations, galactic cosmic rays, destructive dust, meteoroid impacts (direct or indirect), vibrations, and solar particle events, represents one of the greatest challenges in this endeavor. The goal of the project is to develop and demonstrate transformative smart autonomous habitats and related technologies that will adapt, absorb and rapidly recover from expected and unexpected disruptions to deep space habitat systems without fundamental changes in function or sacrifices in safety. Incorporating a system resilience approach will be the turning point in achieving permanent deep space habitats. <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/rethi/">[Project Webpage]</a>

      Recent technological advancements can make it possible to deploy a single robot or a swarm of robots in real-life scenarios such as mining , bridge inspection, search and rescue, space applications, etc. Fully autonomous flight is suitable for many of such missions. Recent advancements in the field of computing might provide robust autonomy. However, in mission-critical scenarios, human presence in the system is still needed to 1) recognize and mitigate shortcomings of the autonomy; 2) have available “out-of-band” information not accessible to the autonomy and that can be utilized to increase performance; 3) convey changes in intent as mission goals change. The aim of the project is to develop robust and natural interaction techniques  to achieve a smooth and safe guiding of a single or multi-robot system. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OUct8qMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">[Papers]</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL4wBhxAfRzwQRzfOwZROzw/videos">[Project Videos]</a>
