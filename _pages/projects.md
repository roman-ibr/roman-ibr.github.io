      Deep space habitats require groundbreaking technological advances to overcome the unprecedented demands introduced by isolation and extreme environments. An Earth-independent permanent extraterrestrial habitat system must function as intended under continuous disruptive conditions that occur during both manned and unmanned conditions. Designing for the demands that extreme environments will place on long-term deep space habitats, such as wild temperature fluctuations, galactic cosmic rays, destructive dust, meteoroid impacts (direct or indirect), vibrations, and solar particle events, represents one of the greatest challenges in this endeavor. The goal of the project is to develop and demonstrate transformative smart autonomous habitats and related technologies that will adapt, absorb and rapidly recover from expected and unexpected disruptions to deep space habitat systems without fundamental changes in function or sacrifices in safety. Incorporating a system resilience approach will be the turning point in achieving permanent deep space habitats. <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/rethi/">Project Webpage</a>
