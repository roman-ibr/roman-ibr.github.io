Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Welcome, I am Wonse Jo and a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Computer and Information Technology, [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/){:target="\_blank"} where I'm majoring in Robotics. My research interest includes Human-Robot Interaction (HRI),  Affective computing/robotics, AI robotics, Environmental robotics, and Multi-robot system (MRS).

As well, I have broder scientific skills and knowledges from mechanics, electronics, and computer science to the human factors, so I strongly believe that I can make everything for any project or researches using my research experiences and skills.

If you want to get more information about me, please check my CV ([PDF]({{ site.cv_pdf_name | prepend: '/assets/pdf/' }}){:target="\_blank"}) or visit my project page in this website ([Link](/projects/)) or contact me via email ([wonsu0513@gmail.com](mailto:wonsu0513@gmail.com)).
